**Learning:** Qt `QPushButton`s set as icon-only often lack visible focus indicators and accessible names, which breaks keyboard navigation. The default `setFocusPolicy` is sometimes disabled (`Qt.FocusPolicy.NoFocus`) for cosmetic reasons, further degrading accessibility.
**Action:** Always enable `Qt.FocusPolicy.StrongFocus` on interactive elements, provide explicit `setToolTip` and `setAccessibleName` values (especially when dynamic, like toggle buttons), and style `:focus` pseudo-states to ensure keyboard users have visual feedback.

## 2025-02-28 - PySide6 Accessible Names & Hover States
**Learning:** PySide6 components like `QPushButton` and `QLineEdit` used dynamically or exclusively for icons/inputs often lack screen reader support and proper mouse affordance if not explicitly configured. `setAccessibleName` ensures screen readers can announce the purpose of these non-text elements. Using custom `QFrame`s for list items requires explicit `:hover` stylesheet definitions to make them feel interactive, unlike native buttons.
**Action:** Always add `setAccessibleName` to inputs and icon-only buttons. Add explicit `:hover` styles to custom `QFrame` interactable containers to provide visual feedback to users, ensuring the UI feels responsive to mouse movement. Always set `setCursor(Qt.CursorShape.PointingHandCursor)` on clickable elements that aren't natively styled to do so.

## 2025-03-05 - Empty States and UI Decluttering
**Learning:** Leaving empty sections (like a "Completed 0" header) and blank spaces when an app has no content increases visual clutter and provides no guidance. Removing these irrelevant elements and introducing clear "empty states" (e.g., "No tasks yet. Add one below!") drastically reduces cognitive load and improves intuitive usage.
**Action:** Always implement empty states for lists or sections that can be empty. Hide section headers or containers when their associated content is empty to declutter the UI.
