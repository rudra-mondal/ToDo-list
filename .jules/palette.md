## 2024-05-15 - Enhancing Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility for Qt Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Qt `QPushButton`s set as icon-only often lack visible focus indicators and accessible names, which breaks keyboard navigation. The default `setFocusPolicy` is sometimes disabled (`Qt.FocusPolicy.NoFocus`) for cosmetic reasons, further degrading accessibility.
**Action:** Always enable `Qt.FocusPolicy.StrongFocus` on interactive elements, provide explicit `setToolTip` and `setAccessibleName` values (especially when dynamic, like toggle buttons), and style `:focus` pseudo-states to ensure keyboard users have visual feedback.
